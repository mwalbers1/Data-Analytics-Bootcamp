# R Programming Notes

## Advanced Data Structures

- A matrix can be thought of as a vector of vectors, where each value in the matrix is the same data type.


- A data frame is very similar to a Pandas DataFrame where each column can be a different data type.


- A tibble is a recent data object introduced by the tidyverse package in R and is an optimized data frame with extra metadata and features. The most current libraries and packages in R use data frames or tibbles; however, older R packages and analysis scripts will still use matrix objects to perform specific functions or analyses.
