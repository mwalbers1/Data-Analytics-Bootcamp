# Module 6 Challenge Project
This project is for the **Module 6 Challenge** on Python APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The World Weather Analysis Lesson notebook is here: [Module-6 Lesson](Module-6%20Lesson.md)

## Overview
This project is a case study for a fictitious PlanMyTrip app which caters to travelers planning their vacations.  There are three deliverables:

1. Retrieve Weather Data
2. Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map

### Deliverable 1
- Collect weather data based on the nearest cities for a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes

- Retrieve the following information from the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap</a> API
    - Latitude and longitude
    - Maximum temperature
    - Percent humidity
    - Percent cloudiness
    - Wind speed
    - Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)

- View Jupyter notebook here: <a href="Weather_Database/Weather_Database.ipynb" target="_blank">Weather Database</a>

### Deliverable 2
- Create list of travel destinations and nearby hotels based on customer's weather preferences

- Show destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers
